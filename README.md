![Alginate](images/YS31736_structure.png) 

## Project Description

This repository contains code for data preparation, statistical analysis, and visualization used in the study "Competitive Biosynthesis of Bacterial Alginate Using Azotobacter vinelandii 12 for Tissue Engineering Applications." The main goal of the project is to provide tools for analyzing and visualizing data related to alginate biosynthesis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

## Methods Applied
The following methods were applied for data analysis and processing:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing missing or inconsistent data entries to ensure data quality.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilizing statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to compare groups and assess significance.
- **Regression Analysis**: Implementing linear regression to model relationships between variables.
- **Data Normalization**: Scaling data to a standard range to facilitate comparison.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Creating various plots (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps) to represent data visually and identify trends.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to group similar data points.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing data collected over time to identify patterns or trends.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing dimensionality of the dataset while preserving variance for better visualization and analysis.
